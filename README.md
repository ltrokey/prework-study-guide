# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created with structure, indented related content, bold formatting, bulletins, order of operation, and screenshots for boot camp students working through prework. This project is designed to help the user understand core foundations of programming and how to use popular developer tools. The project also provides quick and easy access to important tips or notes to aid the user on future projects. On any study guide, it is important that the user not only follows the instructions but also understands the purpose. Once they understand the purpose, they will have the insight on how that information can be infinitely applied to various situations and circumstances. Through this project I learned about the overall work flow from Git, GitHub, terminal, and VS Code.
